    <h4>Onion</h4>
    <p>
Onion, Allium cepa, is an herbaceous biennial in the family
Liliaceae grown for its edible bulb.
The stem of the plant is a flattened disc at the base and the tubular leaves form
a pseudostem where their sheaths overlap.
The onion plant produces pink or white flowers clustered on stalks.
The bulbs are formed just above the flattened stem of the plant by overlapping leaves.<br></br>
The bulb is made up of several layers, each corresponding to a leaf.
The bulb is protected by a membrane which turns to a papery coat. <br></br>
Onion may also be referred to by cultivar and these include red or purple onion,
shallots and spring onions or scallions.
The origin of the onion has not been conclusively determined although it is likely
to be somewhere in South East Asia where the gene pool is most diverse.

    <h4>Potatoes</h4>
    <p>Potato, Solanum tuberosum, is an herbaceous perennial plant in the
        family Solanaceaewhich is grown for its edible tubers.
        The potato plant has a branched stem and alternately arranged leaves consisting of
        leaflets which are both of unequal size and shape.<br></br> 
   The potato plant produces white or blue flowers and yellow-green berries.
   The potato tubers grow underground and generally located in the top 25 cm (10 in) of the soil.
        The tubers can range in color from yellow to red or purple depending on the variety. 
        Potato plants can reach in excess of 1 m (3.3 ft) in height and are grown as annual
        plants, surviving only one growing season.<br></br> 
        Potato may also be referred to as, spud, Irish potato, white potato or Spanish
        potato and originates from South America.</p>

    <h4>Carrot</h4>
    <br>The carrot (Daucus carota subsp. sativus) is a root vegetable,
    usually orange in colour, though purple, black, red, white
    and yellow cultivars exist.
   The plant probably originated in Persia and was originally cultivated
   for its leaves and seeds.<br></br>
    The most commonly eaten part of the plant is the taproot,
    although the stems and leaves are eaten as well.
    The domestic carrot has been selectively bred for its greatly enlarged,
    more palatable, less woody-textured taproot.

The carrot is a biennial plant in the umbellifer family Apiaceae.
At first, it grows a rosette of leaves while building up the enlarged taproot.
Fast-growing cultivars mature within three months (90 days) of sowing the seed,
while slower-maturing cultivars need a month longer (120 days).|</br>

    <h4>Pumpkin</h4>
    <p>A pumpkin is a cultivar of winter squash that is round with smooth,
        slightly ribbed skin, and most often deep yellow to orange in coloration.
        The thick shell contains the seeds and pulp.
        The name is most commonly used for cultivars of Cucurbita pepo,
        but some cultivars of Cucurbita maxima, C. argyrosperma, and C.
Pumpkins are widely grown for commercial use and as food, aesthetics, and recreational purposes.<br></br>
Pumpkin pie, for instance, is a traditional part of Thanksgiving meals in
Canada and the United States, and pumpkins are frequently carved as jack-o'-lanterns for
decoration around Halloween,
although commercially canned pumpkin purée and pumpkin pie fillings are usually made
from different kinds of winter squash than the ones used for jack-o'-lanterns.</p>

    <h4>Tomatoes</h4>
    <p>The tomato is the edible, often red, berry of the plant Solanum lycopersicum,
        commonly known as a tomato plant.
        The species originated in western South America and Central America.
       Its domestication and use as a cultivated food may have originated with the
       indigenous peoples of Mexico.
        From there, the tomato was introduced to other parts of the European-colonized
        world during the 16th century.<br></br>

Tomatoes are a significant source of umami flavor.
The tomato is consumed in diverse ways, raw or cooked, in many dishes,
sauces, salads, and drinks.
While tomatoes are fruits—botanically classified as berries—they
are commonly used as a vegetable ingredient or side dish.

Numerous varieties of the tomato plant are widely grown in temperate climates
across the world, with greenhouses allowing for the production of tomatoes
throughout all seasons of the year.
They are vines that have a weak stem that sprawls and typically needs support.
Indeterminate tomato plants are perennials in their native habitat,
but are cultivated as annuals.</p>

    <h4>Cabbage</h4>
    <p>Cabbage (comprising several cultivars of Brassica oleracea) is a leafy green,
        red (purple),or white (pale green) biennial plant grown as an annual vegetable
    crop for its dense-leaved heads. <br></br>It is descended from the wild cabbage (B. oleracea var.
    oleracea), and belongs to the "cole crops" or brassicas, meaning it is closely related to
    broccoli and cauliflower (var. botrytis); Brussels sprouts (var. gemmifera); and Savoy cabbage
    (var. sabauda).<br>Under conditions of long sunny days, such as those found at high northern
    latitudes in summer, cabbages can grow quite large.
    </br>
Cabbage is a good source of vitamin K, vitamin C and dietary fiber.
World production of cabbage and other brassicas for 2017 was 71 million
tonnes, with China accounting for 47% of the world total.</p>
